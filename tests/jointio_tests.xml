  <test name="power gnd">Use a multi-meter to beep the connection between ground and all of the ground cage-clamps.  Are they all connected?</test>
  <test name="power current">Apply power to the board.  Check it doesn't draw too much current.</test>
  <test name="MSP430 program">Connect to the MSP430.  Can it be programmed?</test>
  <test name="I2C ID">Can you read the correct board identity over I2C?</test>
  <test name="I2C LED flash">Does the I2C LED flash during I2C activity?</test>
  <test name="power 3V3">Measure the voltage on each of the 3.3V cage clamps.  Are they all connected to 3.3V?</test>
  <test name="input gnd">Connect ground to all inputs.  Do they all read zero?</test>
  <test name="input in-turn">Keeping all other inputs connected to ground, connect 12V followed by 1.5V to each input in turn.  Make sure the supply used for these references has a sensible current limit set (e.g. 50mA).  Read the inputs over I2C for each configuration.  For 12V, the reading should be 1023.  For 1.5V, the reading should be approximately 465.</test>
  <test name="input led">Do each of the input LEDs work.</test>
  <test name="output">Go through each of the outputs in turn.  Set that output high, and all others low.  For each configuration, check the voltages on the output cage-clamps are correct.  Check the output LEDs are also correct.</test>
