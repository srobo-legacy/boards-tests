<board name="jointio">
  <test name="power sric">Power the board over SRIC. Should draw around 20mA</test>
  <test name="pic program">
1) Remove all power
2) Connect ICD2
3) Power the board over SRIC
4) Program PIC (Run 'make flash' in boards/interconnet-fw.git)</test>
  <test name="msp430 program">
1) Remove all power
2) Connect UIF
3) Power the board over SRIC
4) Program the MSP</test>
  <test name="power 3V3">
1) Connect to PC-SRIC board
2) Run sricd on PC
3) Run 'jointio.py' in sricd.git/pysric/examples
4) Measure the voltage on each of the 3.3V pins
Result: They should all measure 3.3V</test>
  <test name="input gnd">
1) Press enter on PC to move to the next stage of testing
2) Connect ground to all inputs
Result: All inputs should read zero</test>
  <test name="input in-turn">
1) Keeping all other inputs connected to ground, connect 12V followed by 1.5V to each input in turn
  - Make sure the supply used for these references has a sensible current limit set (e.g. 20mA)
Result:
  - For 12V, the reading should be 1023.
  - For 1.5V, the reading should be approximately 465.
  - Each input LED should represent the state of the pin (on with 12V, off with GND)</test>
  <test name="output">
1) Press enter on PC to move to the last state of testing
2) Keep pressing enter to turn each output on. (Ctrl+C to quit)
Result:
  - The output LED should represent the state of the pin
  - The voltage on the output should be either 0 or 3.3V for low/high</test>
