<board name="power">
  <test name="power battery">1) Insert 15A (Blue) fuse into lower slot.
2) Insert 1A (Black) fuse into slot on the rear of the board.
3) Plug in power switch.
4) Connect 12V to the battery input.
5) Close power switch.
Result: Should draw around ???mA.</test>
  <test name="power battery LEDs">Check that the '3V3' LED is on.</test>
  <test name="MSP430 program">1) Open power switch.
2) Conncet UIF.
3) Close power switch.
4) Program MSP.
5) Run code.
Result: Code runs.</test>
  <test name="test-mode enter">1) Open power switch.
2) Hold down the two buttons to the lower right of the screen.
3) Close power switch.
Result: Tune plays through piezo. CHARGE, debug(SRIC activity) and motor rail LEDs flash.</test>
  <test name="test-mode buttons">Press each button in turn, an LED should toggle. Press/turn rotary encoders, more LEDs should toggle.</test>
  <test name="test-mode motor rail">Measure the voltage on the motor rail. Should be toggling between 0 and 12V.</test>
  <test name="test-mode motor rail load">Load the motor rail, preferably with 60W or more. Nothing should break, load should turn on/off.</test>
  <test name="power beagleboard">1) Open power switch.
2) Close power switch.
Result: 5V LED should turn on. 5V rail should be 5V.</test>
  <test name="power usb">Measure the voltage on the USB hub power socket. Should be 5V.</test>
  <test name="power beagleboard">1) Open power switch.
2) Disconnect 12V from the battery input.
3) Mount BeagleBoard.
4) Connect 12V to the battery input.
5) Close power switch.
Result: Should draw around ??mA. After 3 seconds backlight should illuminate.</test>
  <test name="slug boot">Boot slug.  Shell into it.</test>
  <test name="slug LEDs">Check each user LED on the slug using the following python code:
from sr import *
import time
for x in range(0,4):
  power.led[x] = 1
  time.sleep(1)
  power.led[x] = 0
  time.sleep(1)

Check that each light flashes in turn.</test>

<test name="slug dipsw">Check the dip switches from python by running the following:

from sr import *
while 1:
  for x in range(0,4):
    power.led[x] = power.switch[x]

Check that the LEDs represent the current state of the switches.
</test>
<test name="I2C connectors">Talk to and power another (known-working) board through all the RJ11 connectors.</test>
</board>
