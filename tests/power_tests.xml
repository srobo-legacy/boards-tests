<board name="power">
  <test name="power battery">Disconnect charger input.  Connect 12V to the battery input.  
Connect the power switch.  Close it.  Make sure it doesn't current limit.</test>
  <test name="power battery LEDs">Check that the following lights are on (look at power board outline diagram):
 - Run
 - Master power
 - 3.3V logic power</test>
  <test name="power current 3V3">Short the 3.3V rail.  Check nothing catches fire.  The switch-mode should current-limit.</test>
  <test name="MSP430 program">Connect to the MSP430.  Program it (and run code).</test>
  <test name="power USB">Check that 5V reaches the USB power connector.</test>
  <test name="power slug">Check that the slug rail is 5V.</test>

  <test name="slug boot">Boot slug.  Shell into it.</test>
  <test name="slug LEDs">Check each user LED on the slug using the following python code:
from sr import *
import time
for x in range(0,4):
  power.led[x] = 1
  time.sleep(1)
  power.led[x] = 0
  time.sleep(1)

Check that each light flashes in turn.</test>

<test name="slug dipsw">Check the dip switches from python by running the following:

from sr import *
while 1:
  for x in range(0,4):
    power.led[x] = power.switch[x]

Check that the LEDs represent the current state of the switches.
