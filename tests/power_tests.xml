<board name="power">
  <test name="power battery">1) Insert 15A (Blue) fuse into lower slot.
2) Insert 1A (Black) fuse into slot on the rear of the board.
3) Plug in power switch.
4) Connect 12V to the battery input.
5) Close power switch.
Result: Should draw around 30mA. (Both 3.3V rail and 5V rail will be on)</test>
  <test name="power battery LEDs">Check that the '3V3' and '5V' LEDs are on.</test>
  <test name="MSP430 program">1) Open power switch.
2) Conncet UIF.
3) Close power switch.
4) Program MSP.
5) Run code.
Result: Code runs.</test>
  <test name="test-mode enter">1) Open power switch.
2) Hold down the two buttons to the lower right of the screen.
3) Close power switch.
Result: Tune plays through piezo. CHARGE, debug(SRIC activity) and motor rail LEDs flash.</test>
  <test name="test-mode buttons">Press each button in turn, an LED should toggle. Press/turn rotary encoders, more LEDs should toggle.</test>
  <test name="test-mode motor rail">Measure the voltage on the motor rail. Should be toggling between 0 and 12V.</test>
  <test name="test-mode motor rail load">Load the motor rail, preferably with 60W or more. Nothing should break, load should turn on/off.</test>
  <test name="power beagleboard">1) Open power switch.
2) Close power switch.
Result: 5V LED should turn on. 5V rail should be 5V.</test>
  <test name="power usb">Measure the voltage on the USB hub power socket. Should be 5V.</test>
  <test name="power beagleboard">1) Open power switch.
2) Disconnect 12V from the battery input.
3) Mount BeagleBoard.
4) Connect 12V to the battery input.
5) Close power switch.
6) Wait about 1 minute for the BeagleBoard to boot. LED USR0 on the BealgeBoard should be flashing in a 'heartbeat' pattern and USR1 should be off.
Result: Should draw around 165mA.</test>
  <test name="power lcd">Measure LCD 2.5V rail, should be 2.5V.</test>
  <test name="power lcd backlight">Measure LCD backlight voltage, should be anywhere between 32V and 39V.</test>
  <test name="power lcd assemble">1) Open power switch.
2) Disconnect 12V from the battery input.
3) Connect LCD.
4) Add insulating pad behind LCD.
5) Connect 12V to the battery input.
6) Close power switch.
Result: Backlight should illuminate after 3 seconds.</test>
  <test name="slug boot">Boot slug.  Shell into it.</test>
  <test name="slug LEDs">Check each user LED on the slug using the following python code:
from sr import *
import time
for x in range(0,4):
  power.led[x] = 1
  time.sleep(1)
  power.led[x] = 0
  time.sleep(1)

Check that each light flashes in turn.</test>

<test name="slug dipsw">Check the dip switches from python by running the following:

from sr import *
while 1:
  for x in range(0,4):
    power.led[x] = power.switch[x]

Check that the LEDs represent the current state of the switches.
</test>
<test name="I2C connectors">Talk to and power another (known-working) board through all the RJ11 connectors.</test>
</board>
