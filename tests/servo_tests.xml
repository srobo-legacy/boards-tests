<board name="power">
  <test name="power sric">Power the board over SRIC. Should draw around 30mA</test>
  <test name="power servo">Power the board through the servo power connector. Should draw 0mA</test>
  <test name="pic program">
1) Remove all power
2) Connect ICD2
3) Power the board over SRIC
4) Program PIC (rum 'make flash' in boards/interconnect-fw.git)</test>
  <test name="msp430 program">
1) Remove all power
2) Connect UIF
3) Power the board over SRIC
4) Program the MSP</test>
  <test name="sric smps">
1) Connect to PC-SRIC board
2) Run sricd on PC
3) Run 'servo.py' in sricd.git/pysric/examples
4) Measure the voltage on each of the 5V pins
Result: They should all measure 5V</test>
  <test name="sric servo single">Connect a single servo to each output in turn. It should turn</test>
  <test name="sric servo all">Connect a servo to every output (if you have enough servos). They should all turn</test>
