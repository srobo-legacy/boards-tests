<board name="motor">
  <test name="power sric">Power the board over SRIC. Should draw around 40mA</test>
  <test name="power motor">Power the board through the main power connector. Should draw around 20mA</test>
  <test name="msp430 program">1) Remove all power.
2) Connect UIF.
3) Power the board over SRIC.
4) Program MSP.
5) Run code.
Result: Code runs.</test>
  <test name="motor noload">1) Connect PC-SRIC board.
2) Run sricd on PC.
3) Use pyenv to control the speed/direction of the output as follows:
  a) Forward full speed
  b) Backwards full speed
  c) Stop
  d) Forward half speed
  e) Backward half speed
Result: The LEDs next to the motor connector should change in brightness depending on the direction/speed set.</test>
  <test name="motor load small">Repeat the above test with a small load connected. The load should indicate the speed/direction set. The board should not current limit (the red LED in the middle of the board should not illuminate).</test>
  <test name="motor load large">Repeat the above test with a large (5A) load connected. The board should not current limit.</test>
  <test name="motor load short">Repeat the above test with the output terminals shorted. The red LED in the middle of the board should illuminate indicating that the board is current limiting. No smoke should be observed.</test>
  <test name="motor endurance">Leave the board driving the large load for 1 hour. The board should still be functioning after the hour.</test>
