<board name="motor">
  <test name="power current 3V3">Power the board's 3.3V rail.  Check it doesn't draw too much current.</test>
  <test name="power current 12V">Power the board's 12V rail (whilst the 3.3V rail is still connected).  Check it doesn't draw too much current.</test>
  <test name="MSP430 program">Connect to the MSP430.  Program it.</test>
  <test name="I2C ID">Read the correct board identity over I2C.</test>
  <test name="I2C LED">Check the I2C LED flashes during I2C transactions.</test>
  <test name="motor LEDs">Switch through all the motor output states, and check that the channel state LEDs are functioning.</test>
  <test name="feedback gnd">Connect ground to all feedback inputs.  Check they all read '0'.</test>
  <test name="feedback in-turn">Connect 12V to each feedback input in turn whilst all others are connected to 0V.  Check it reads '1'.</test>
  <test name="motor control">Do the following for each channel.  Plug motor in.  Check that it can be driven forwards, backwards, and stopped.  Check it can be driven at half speed forwards and backwards.  Check the PWM state LED changes brightness with different power outputs.</test>
  <test name="motor endurance">Connect the maximum load to each channel.  Run for several hours (probably 24, but this is still under debate).</test>
